# TODOs and Ideas

Features that I might consider as features or improvements in the future. Not all ideas might be viable, or even _good_, but this helps me avoid forgetting them until I decide what to do.

- Double-check that renaming is stripping out invalid characters.
- Stop checking for `.Any()` files when starting requested operations.
- Genre-extraction: Create a local file containing tag data so that the files don't have to be re-read (but maybe not worth it since this operation isn't done much?)
- Extract all metadata to JSON or XML?
